# API Documentation

There are currently two flavors of api documentation at the moment. Both should be considered a rough draft. Test and verify anything in multiple safe ways.

## Postman
Import this into Postman if you'd like to use it to post trial messages to a server without using the command line. Set the `server_ip` to the location of your running instance of TAP. For example, if running locally via `npm run-script start`, use `localhost:3000`. If running in a cloud-based virtual machine, enter its IP address.

## Swagger
To utilize it, navigate to https://editor.swagger.io/ (or stand up a local via yaml instance) and replace the sample code with the conext of this file: `swagger-api-documentation.yaml`.
